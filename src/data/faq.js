        question: 'What is the Fringe Science Fund?',
        answer:
          'The Fringe Science Fund is an organization dedicated to funding high-risk, high-reward scientific research that challenges mainstream scientific orthodoxy. We support scientists working on unconventional ideas that have the potential to create revolutionary breakthroughs but are often rejected by traditional funding sources.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Why focus on "fringe" science?',
        answer:
          'As Thomas Kuhn showed in "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions," major breakthroughs come from paradigm shifts that often begin as fringe ideas. Historically, revolutionary concepts like heliocentrism, relativity, and quantum mechanics all started outside the mainstream. Today, the scientific establishment has become increasingly centralized and risk-averse, making it difficult for truly revolutionary ideas to get funding. We believe investing in these unconventional ideas is crucial for civilization\'s progress.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Are you funding pseudoscience?',
        answer:
          'No. We fund scientifically sound research that follows the scientific method but challenges current paradigms. We differentiate between fringe science (which is testable, falsifiable, and methodologically sound but challenges current models) and pseudoscience (which makes claims that cannot be tested or falsified). Our scientific advisors carefully evaluate proposals for scientific rigor while allowing for paradigm-challenging hypotheses.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How is this different from existing science funding?',
        answer:
          "Traditional funding sources (government grants, university funding, mainstream foundations) tend to favor incremental advances within established paradigms. Projects are often judged by peers who have a vested interest in the current scientific consensus. We specifically look for ideas that challenge established frameworks, taking inspiration from venture capital's approach to high-risk, high-reward investments.",

    category: 'For Scientists',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'What kind of projects do you fund?',
        answer:
          'We fund research projects that challenge established scientific paradigms in physics, chemistry, biology, energy, consciousness studies, and other fields. We look for ideas that could lead to revolutionary breakthroughs but are too unconventional for traditional funding sources. The key criteria are scientific rigor, testability, and revolutionary potential.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Do I need academic credentials to apply?',
        answer:
          'No. We value ideas over credentials. While academic experience can be valuable, many breakthrough ideas come from outsiders or those working at the margins of established fields. We welcome applications from independent researchers, citizen scientists, and unconventional thinkers, as well as academically trained scientists.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How much funding do you provide?',
        answer:
          "Funding amounts vary based on the project's needs, typically ranging from $10,000 to $500,000. We provide enough funding to allow for meaningful experimentation and testing of revolutionary hypotheses. For especially promising projects that show initial results, additional funding rounds may be available.",
      },
      {
        question: 'What is the application process?',
        answer:
          'The application process begins with submitting a proposal that outlines your idea, why it challenges current scientific orthodoxy, what experiments or research you plan to conduct, and what revolutionary implications success might have. Promising proposals undergo review by our scientific advisors, who evaluate both scientific rigor and revolutionary potential. Final decisions are made based on these evaluations and available funding.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What do you expect in return for funding?',
        answer:
          "We expect funded scientists to conduct their research with integrity, document their work, and share results openly. We don't take ownership of intellectual property but may request acknowledgment in publications. For projects with commercial potential, we may discuss equity arrangements, but our primary goal is advancing revolutionary science, not profit.",

    category: 'For Investors',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'How can I invest in the Fringe Science Fund?',
        answer:
          'There are several ways to invest: as an Angel Investor directly supporting specific projects, as a Fund Contributor to our general portfolio, as a Strategic Partner focused on particular research areas, or as a Philanthropic Supporter making tax-deductible donations. Contact our investor relations team to discuss which option best aligns with your goals.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What return on investment can I expect?',
        answer:
          "Like venture capital, most funded projects won't yield financial returns. However, those that succeed could generate extraordinary returns by creating entirely new industries or technologies. Beyond financial returns, investors benefit from access to our network of innovative scientists, early knowledge of breakthrough discoveries, and the legacy impact of supporting civilization-changing science.",
      },
      {
        question: 'Is there a minimum investment amount?',
        answer:
          "Minimum investments vary by investment model. Fund contributors typically start at $50,000, while angel investments in specific projects may have different minimums depending on the project's needs. Philanthropic donations can be made at any level. Contact us to discuss options that fit your investment capacity.",
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you ensure scientific rigor in funded projects?',
        answer:
          'While we fund unconventional ideas, we maintain scientific rigor through our evaluation process. Our scientific advisors assess each proposal for proper methodology, testable hypotheses, and experimental design. We embrace challenging paradigms but require adherence to scientific principles. Funded projects receive ongoing oversight to ensure they maintain scientific integrity.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What happens if projects fail?',
        answer:
          'Most will fail â€“ that\'s the nature of high-risk investment. We embrace this reality as part of our venture capital-inspired approach. When projects don\'t yield the hoped-for breakthroughs, we document the learnings and share them with our scientific community. These "productive failures" still contribute valuable knowledge and help refine future research directions.',

          'You can support our mission by spreading awareness about the importance of fringe science, subscribing to our newsletter to stay informed about breakthroughs, sharing our content on social media, participating in community discussions, or making smaller donations. Every contributor helps build the momentum for a new scientific renaissance.',

        question: 'Do you host events or conferences?',
        answer:
          'Yes, we organize both virtual and in-person events that bring together scientists, investors, and enthusiasts interested in paradigm-challenging research. These include conferences, workshops, webinars, and discussion forums. Subscribe to our newsletter to stay informed about upcoming events.',
